## About
MindefulMedia is a media tracker designed specifically for video games. Users will be able to track what games they want to play, are currently playing, and have completed. Users will be able to sort games 
based on categories, rate them, and create a personal log for thoughts on each respective game. The rating system will be implemented to prioritize highly rated games to make it easier for the user to 
find more games they want to try. Unlike other generic media trackers, MindfulMedia will focus fully on video game tracking for accurate and in depth game analytics.
